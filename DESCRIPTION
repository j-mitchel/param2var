Description: The function provided by this package aims to make it easier to
    debug functions with many parameters. To debug such functions, it is common
    to first assign the broken function's parameters as global variables. Then,
    one can run the individual lines of the function to determine where it is broken.
    As it can be a frustration to individually assign dozens of variables, this
    package can be used to automatically assign a functions default parameters to
    global variables. It can also override the defaults and globally set the values 
    of any other specified parameters.
